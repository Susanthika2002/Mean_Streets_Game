# Mean_Streets_Game
It is an old adventure game where you play a private investigator who gets hired to investigate a suspected murder. In the game, you fly around across town to interview people, and if you ask the right questions they give up new clues. When arriving at a new scene, the character can inspect the scene and the usual objects. Doing the right action to right object reveals new thing.
